### CPSC 120

* Lab 7/ part-1

Lab 7, part-1 was a favorite because, even though I struggled a lot with it at first, I learned a lot from this lab and that is what I liked about it. I learned how to use the flowcharts to resolve a linker error I kept getting. I also learned more about header files and the purpose they serve in a program.

* Lab 8/ part-2

Lab 8, part-2 was a favorite of mine because I enjoy statistical analysis. In chemistry laboratories, I often have to calculate the average using excel. Now, using what I have learned in this lab, I can calculate an average using C++.

* Lab 10/ part-1

Lab 10, part-1 was a favorite of mine because I have always been interested in prime numbers. I learned how to use the modulo operator to check if a number is prime. I also enjoyed working with data from a file because in the future as a data analyst it is something I may have to do.
